# Employee Attrition Analysis

This analysis seeks to determine predictive factors that influence employee attrition. All firms expect a certain degree of attrition, which may stem from retirement, a desire for career growth, or termination of employment due to unsatisfactory performance. 

However, a high level of attrition can impose costs on a firm in terms of rehiring, training, productivity, and customer relationship management. Thus, it is important for firms to appropriately manage the factors that lead to excessive attrition. 

In human resources literature, several largely preventable factors have been identified as top drivers of attrition, including:

- Better pay and opportunities are available elsewhere 
- Work/life balance is inadequate
- Managers and/or peers behave improperly
- Teams are ineffectively managed
- Employees face a lack of recognition or limited prospects for growth 

Working conditions are inadequate To explore the relationship between these and other factors and employee attrition, in this notebook I examined an IBM business analytics dataset that contained several variables relevant to staff attrition. By employing a number of statistical methods, we will build a predictive model for employee attrition, which can be used to identify risk factors that help firms mitigate the impact of excessive attrition.
